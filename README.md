## ✨ Features

- **🔗 Dual Integration** – Connect Spotify & Navidrome simultaneously
- **🎯 Smart Matching** – ISRC, fuzzy, and strict matching strategies
- **📊 Batch Export** – Export multiple playlists at once
- **🔄 Differential Exporting** – Sync only new tracks (single browser session)
- **📤 JSON Export** – Export unmatched tracks as JSON
- **⚡ Real-time Progress** – Live export tracking with match statistics
- **👁️ Export Preview** – Review matches before committing

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Connect** – Login to Spotify and enter Navidrome credentials
2. **Select** – Browse and check playlists to export
3. **Export** – Review matches and start the transfer

---

## 🎯 How It Works

**Matching Strategy Chain:**

1. **ISRC** → Exact match via unique recording code
2. **Fuzzy** → Similarity matching (80% threshold)
3. **Strict** → Normalized exact string match

Unmatched tracks can be exported as JSON for later addition to Navidrome.

## ⚙️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17+
- Spotify Developer account
- Spotify Premium account (required for Web API access)
- Running Navidrome instance

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/betsha1830/navispot.git
cd navispot
bun install

# Configure
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# Run
bun dev
```

> **Note:** Spotify requires HTTPS for redirect URIs. If you're developing locally, use `bun dev --experimental-https` instead of `bun dev`. This generates a self-signed cert and serves your app over HTTPS at `https://localhost:3000`. You may also need to use your local network address (e.g., `https://192.168.x.x:3000`) and add it as a redirect URI in the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

**Spotify Setup:**

1. Create app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Add one of the following as your Redirect URI. or to Redirect URIs. Spotify only allows the following loopback addresses: `http://127.0.0.1:PORT` or `http://[::1]:PORT`
  1. localhost: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback`
  2. Remote host: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback`
4. Copy Client ID & Secret to `.env.local`

---

## 📦 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**Production Variables:**

```env
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback # localhost: http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth/callback
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com #localhost: http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Update Spotify Dashboard with your production redirect URI.
